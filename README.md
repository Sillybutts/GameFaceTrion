Mods for the Game Face Trion.

## Description

### This repository is a collection of mods for the Game Face Trion blaster:

- **Spacers**
- - 3 sizes. 
- - 1x is a 1:1 copy of the included Trion spacer. 
- - 2x is the length of the two spacers included. 
- - 2.75x is the maximum extra length that the blaster can fit. Spring might take a set/be damaged over time with this spacer.

- **Spacer Holders**
- - 3 types
- - Picatinny mounted
- - Buffer tube mounted
- - MLOK slot mounted

- **Flared Magwell**
- - WIP


- **New Muzzles & SCARs**
- - SCAR Lookalike Muzzle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT8aSmv8EyI
- - MegaXL Spigot SCAR
- - SCAR inserts for default included Trion muzzle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa9wTFDM8aU
- - SillyCollet quick barrel swap muzzle (by Chance) (The collet requires an 016 o-ring to grab onto the barrel. Can be substituted by a rubber band if need be.)
- - Print all of these muzzle things with supports. Preferably tree supports, only touching buildplate. Might need a brim with the SCARs.
